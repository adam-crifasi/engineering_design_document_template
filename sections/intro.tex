This design document class provides template for simple, legible, organized design documents.  It's recommended that the sections are divided into their own separate files (as is this intro), although it is not required.  This sample document will provide examples of the formatting standards included in this document in order to keep this document (and others) streamlined and cohesive.

This intro section should provide a high level overview of the product, in order for the reader to understand the subject matter before diving into the design details.
